# MedBridge-A — Frontend

AI-Powered Patient Health Companion. This repository holds the **frontend** web
app: patients upload or paste a medical document and receive a plain-language
summary, a health dashboard, and actionable next steps.

**Tech stack:** React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Recharts

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and npm (check with `node -v`)

### Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/Coding-Temple-Tech-Residency/MedBridge-A.git
cd MedBridge-A

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env        # then open .env and adjust values if needed

# 4. Start the dev server
npm run dev                 # serves at http://localhost:5173
```

The app boots at the URL Vite prints (default `http://localhost:5173`).

### Environment variables

All client-side env vars must be prefixed with `VITE_` (Vite only exposes those).
They are validated at startup by `src/env.ts` — a missing or malformed value
throws a clear error immediately instead of failing silently later.

| Variable            | Required | Description                        | Example                 |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Yes      | Base URL of the MedBridge backend. | `http://localhost:8000` |

### Available scripts

| Script                 | What it does                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`          | Start the Vite dev server with hot reload.         |
| `npm run build`        | Type-check and produce a production build.         |
| `npm run preview`      | Serve the production build locally.                |
| `npm run lint`         | Run ESLint over the codebase (zero warnings = OK). |
| `npm run format`       | Format all files with Prettier.                    |
| `npm run format:check` | Check formatting without writing changes.          |

## Project structure

```
src/
  components/    Page + UI components (Login, Landing, Upload, Results, Header, Logo)
  env.ts         Validated environment-variable access
  mockData.ts    Sample report + mock analysis result (placeholder until API is wired)
  types.ts       Shared TypeScript types
  App.tsx        Top-level view switching
  main.tsx       React entry point
```

---

## Notes / known limitations

- The analysis flow currently runs on **mock data** (`src/mockData.ts`); the
  backend API is not yet wired in. Login and document analysis are simulated.
- Auth is **UI-only** at this stage — real `POST /api/auth/*` calls, JWT storage,
  and protected routing are tracked in later Sprint 1 issues (FE-05, FE-06, FE-07)
  and depend on the API-contract sync (FE-08).

---

## Development standards

- Clean, modular, well-named code; no stray `console.log`s or unused files.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` pass before opening a PR.
- Meaningful commit messages; keep `main` green — no broken pushes.
- Review teammates' PRs respectfully and constructively.
